### Exercises

* Modify the `greet` function in `wasm-game-of-life/src/lib.rs` to take a `name: &str` parameter that customizes the alerted message, and pass your name to the `greet` function from inside `wasm-game-of-life/wasm-app/index.js`. Rebuild the `.wasm` binary with `wasm-pack build`, then refresh in your web browser and you should see a customized greeting!

Answer:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) {
  alert(&format!("Hello, {}!", name));
}
```

```rust
wasm.greet("Your name");
```
